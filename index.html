        <p>Hello! I am Chanyah Johnson and welcome to my page.
            I am a sophmore at Penn State's Main Campus majoring in Human-Centered Design and Development with a
        focus in Informatics.  My major has equipped me with a wide range of technical, design, and teamwork skills. In past projects I have
            worked to create prototypes for apps in group projects as well as
            doing some back-end work on applications as well. Additionally, I am pursuing a minor in Security Risk and Analysis. As far as involvement I
            am mainly involved in two organizations here at Penn State which are the National Society of Black Engineers and WIRED-In
            which are both clubs where students of all backgrounds, specifically students who feel underrepresented in
            the field of technology,
            to come together and build connections.
            I am currently pursuing a career in Software Development. As of right now, I am working as a learning
            assistant in the College of IST.
            Currently in my job as a Learning Assistant for the Introduction to Application Development course in the
            College of IST, I spend a lot of time with the two other
            LAs as well as the
            course instructor figuring out ways to make the students' learning experience better.
            Solutions that I have personally come up with are making in class problems for the students to work on to better understand the material, as well as suggesting to the instructor
            ways that he may be able to make the students experience in the class better.
            That includes going over homework problems or even spending more time going over example problems.
            These suggestions have allowed me to be able to help the students in areas they were struggling as well as encouraged them to seek help in my office hours.
            The very little suggestions that I, or even the other LAs may come up with, helps to improve the overall learning of the course for the students which I am proud to share.
            <br>I am originally
        from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  In my freetime, I like to watch TV, listen to music, and take part in fun activities.
        Some of my favorite shows include Glee, Greys Anatomy, and Big Bang Theory. My favorite music artists include
            Beyonce, Drake, and The Weeknd. Some of my favorite activities include bowling, Topgolf, and going to the arcade. </p>
