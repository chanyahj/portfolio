        <p>Hello! I am Chanyah Johnson and welcome to my page.
            I am a sophmore at Penn State's Main Campus majoring in Human-Centered Design and Development with a
            minor in Security and Risk Analysis.  My major has equipped me with a wide range of technical, design, and teamwork skills. In past projects I have
            worked to create prototypes for apps in group projects as well as
            doing some front end and back-end work on applications as well. .
        </p>
        <p>
            I am currently pursuing a career in Software Development. As of right now, I am working as a learning
            assistant in the College of IST.
            Currently in my job as a Learning Assistant for the Introduction to Application Development course in the
            College of IST, I spend a lot of time with the two other
            LAs as well as the
            course instructor figuring out ways to make the students' learning experience better.
            Solutions that I have personally come up with are making in class problems for the students to work on to better understand the material, as well as suggesting to the instructor
            ways that he may be able to make the students experience in the class better.
            That includes going over homework problems or even spending more time going over example problems.
            These suggestions have allowed me to be able to help the students in areas they were struggling as well as encouraged them to seek help in my office hours.
            The very little suggestions that I, or even the other LAs may come up with, helps to improve the overall learning of the course for the students which I am proud to share.
        </p>
        <p>I am originally
            from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  In my freetime, I like to watch TV, listen to music, and take part in fun activities.
            Some of my favorite shows include Glee, Greys Anatomy, and Big Bang Theory. My favorite music artists include
            Beyonce, Drake, and The Weeknd. Some of my favorite activities include bowling, Topgolf, and going to the arcade. </p>

            <h2>About My Major</h2>
            <p style="text-align: center">B.S. Human-Centered Design and Development, Minor in Security and Risk Analysis</p>
            <p>Human-Centered Design and Development is the study of how to identify, design, build, and
                evaluate technologies to enhance peopleâ€™s lives. The field focuses on understanding people
                and their use of technology, the methods and tools used for designing and building
                effective technology solutions, and the modern information technologies used to create
                effective solutions. The field involves working with potential users and customers to
                understand their needs and unique contexts, and then how to design, build, and evaluate
                impactful products and services. Human-centered design and development integrates ideas
                from design thinking, human-computer interaction (HCI), interaction design,
                and user experience design with the skills and techniques needed for software development.</p>
            <h2>About my Minor</h2>
            <p style="text-align: center">Minor: Security and Risk Analysis</p>
            <p>Security and risk analysis is a field that explores the integrated processes conducted to
                provide decision-makers with the information needed to understand factors that can
                negatively influence operations and outcomes, and make informed judgments concerning
                the extent of actions needed to reduce vulnerabilities, protect resources, and optimize
                investments. Security and risk analysis is a field of practice with two blended
                concentration areas: </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Security, which seeks to identify, understand, and analyze
                    critical local, national and international security issues</li>
                <li>Risk, which includes risk assessment, risk characterization, risk communication,
                    risk management, and the formulation of risk policy.</li>
            </ol>
          <p>  In practice,
            the issues and processes for conducting of security and risk analytics are
            neither separate nor sequential. To be effective,
            the issues of security and risk must be addressed concurrently and synergistically.</p>
