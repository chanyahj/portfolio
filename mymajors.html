<h1>About My Degree</h1>
<div class="my-major">
    <h2>Major: Human-Centered Design and Development</h2>
    <p>Human-Centered Design and Development is the study of how to identify, design, build, and
        evaluate technologies to enhance peopleâ€™s lives. The field focuses on understanding people
        and their use of technology, the methods and tools used for designing and building
        effective technology solutions, and the modern information technologies used to create
        effective solutions. The field involves working with potential users and customers to
        understand their needs and unique contexts, and then how to design, build, and evaluate
        impactful products and services. Human-centered design and development integrates ideas
        from design thinking, human-computer interaction (HCI), interaction design,
        and user experience design with the skills and techniques needed for software development.</p>

    <h2>Minor: Security and Risk Analysis</h2>
<p>Security and risk analysis is a field that explores the integrated processes conducted to
    provide decision-makers with the information needed to understand factors that can
    negatively influence operations and outcomes, and make informed judgments concerning
    the extent of actions needed to reduce vulnerabilities, protect resources, and optimize
    investments. Security and risk analysis is a field of practice with two blended
    concentration areas:
    <ol>
    <li> Security, which seeks to identify, understand, and analyze
    critical local, national and international security issues</li>
   <li> Risk, which includes risk assessment, risk characterization, risk communication,
    risk management, and the formulation of risk policy.</li>
</ol>
    In practice,
    the issues and processes for conducting of security and risk analytics are
    neither separate nor sequential. To be effective,
    the issues of security and risk must be addressed concurrently and synergistically.</p>
